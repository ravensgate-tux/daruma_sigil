Daruma (達磨) are traditional Japanese “wish” dolls. You color one eye when you set an intention and fill in the other when it’s realized. This guide turns a daruma into a **sigil device** that blends Discordian play with practical results.

> Use respectfully. This is a modern, personal practice inspired by Japanese folk custom, not a replacement for the original tradition.

## Quick Start (2-Minute Version)
1. **Intention → Phrase**: Write one present‑tense sentence (e.g., “My book launch goes smoothly”).  
2. **Make Sigil**: Cross out vowels & repeats → stylize remaining letters into a glyph.  
3. **Prime the Daruma**: Hold the glyph behind the left eye (physically or imagined).  
4. **Charge** (pick one): deep laughter, 23 counted breaths, dance for 55 seconds.  
5. **Eye In**: While charged, **paint the left eye** (or apply a dot sticker) and **forget**.  
6. **Live as if handled**. When the intention is realized, **paint the right eye**.  
7. **Release**: Thank the daruma; store, reset, or retire it.

You can do this with a paper print or an image on your phone if no doll is available.

## Why It Works (Psycho‑Magical Model)
- **Commitment cue**: eye‑in marks the “start.”
- **Compression**: sigil condenses intent into a compact symbol that’s easy to recall and hard to ruminate on.  
- **Charge**: brief arousal (laughter, breath, music, fear‑of‑the‑silly) imprints the symbol.  
- **Forgetting**: reduces counter‑intent and lets habits execute in the background.  
- **Discordian play**: loosens fixation; paradox helps bypass resistance.

## Materials
- A daruma doll (any size/color). Paper or screen image also works.  
- Fine brush or dot sticker for the pupils.  
- Pen/marker and small paper for the sigil. Optional: washi tape to attach the sigil under the base.

> **Reset tip**: If you want to reuse a daruma, cover eyes with white dot stickers or paint white circles to “blank” it.

## The Ritual (Detailed)
1. **Define** (≤ 12 words, present tense, affirmative).  
   - “I deliver the manuscript by the deadline.”  
   - Avoid negatives and other people’s free will. Aim for what _you_ do/experience.
2. **Construct the Sigil**  
   - Remove vowels and duplicate letters.  
   - Combine remaining letters into a pleasing glyph. Sketch 3–5 variants; pick the one that “clicks.”
3. **Consign**  
   - Tuck the glyph inside the daruma (tape under base) or visualize it glowing behind the left eye.
4. **Discordian Charge (choose one)**  
   - **Law of Fives**: laugh loudly _five_ times, then inhale for **5**, hold for **5**, exhale for **5**, hold for **5** (×5 rounds).  
   - **23 Pulse**: drum or clap **23** times, speeding up slightly.  
   - **Fnord Gaze**: stare at the left eye, soft focus, whisper “fnord” until the glyph feels _inevitable_.  
   - **Kinetic**: dance like a holy fool for **55** seconds.
5. **Eye‑In (Activation)**  
   - On the peak of charge, **paint the left eye** while holding the sigil in mind.
6. **Release & Obfuscate**  
   - Put the sigil away. Do **one mundane action** that moves the intention (email, schedule, prep). Then drop it.
7. **Completion**  
   - When the intention manifests, **paint the right eye**. Say thanks. Photograph if you like and archive.
8. **Retire / Reuse**  
   - Keep as a trophy, gift to a river/forest respectfully, or reset with white dots.

## Variations
- **Eye‑Sigil**: stylize the pupil itself as the glyph.  
- **Back‑Panel**: draw the sigil on the back of the daruma or inside the base plug.  
- **Multi‑Goal (not recommended)**: separate daruma per intention; or stack mini‑daruma (one per sub‑task).  
- **No Doll Mode**: print a daruma outline; draw/erase eyes with a pen. Works in a notes app too.  
- **Banishing**: snap fingers **5** times, or say “DISCORDIA APPROVES” and clap once.

## Ethics & Safety
- Aim for goals that are legal, consensual, and healthy.  
- Keep cultural respect: daruma are folk objects of perseverance; treat them kindly.  
- Not a substitute for medical/financial/legal advice.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Nothing happens** → Did you also take one mundane step after activation? Reduce scope; choose a tighter, do‑able intention.  
- **Overthinking the sigil** → Make a new glyph fast in 60 seconds; charge with laughter; hide it.  
- **Forgot to finish** → Set a 23‑day check‑in; if stalled, reset eye with a white sticker and re‑cast.

## Example (Walkthrough)
**Intention**: “My book launch goes smoothly.”  
Letters (no vowels/dupes): `MYBKLNCHGSSMLY` → compress → `MBKLGSMY` → glyph → _(draw your symbol)_.  
Charge with **23 Pulse**. Paint left eye. Email PR list (one mundane step). When launch wraps, paint right eye; retire.

## FAQ
**Q. Can I start with the right eye?**  
A. Traditional flow is left‑first; if your local custom differs, follow that. Consistency beats dogma.

**Q. Both eyes are already painted—what now?**  
A. Use white dot stickers to blank one eye, or use Eye‑Sigil inside the pupil.

**Q. Colors matter?**  
A. Not really. Pick what delights you. Black/gold looks great; red is classic.

**Q. Group working?**  
A. Yes—one daruma per person, or one giant goal with many mini‑daruma.
